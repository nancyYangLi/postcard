# Postcard Creator

I choose the "Postcard Creator" to develop because it is an interesting and simple-to use PHP MVC web application. 
I have worked on everything from front-end HTML, CSS, JavaScript and AJAX to the server side code(PHP) and 
database(SQLite). It has been a wonderful experience creating various postcards for my sweet love newborn twins!
 
### Service Pack

* [Apache]- a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package 
* [SQLite] - a relational database management system contained in a C programming library

### Setup

To successfully run the demo, complete the following steps:

  -- Unzip the files from postcard.zip (See Folder Structure)
  -- Place the top directory postcard and its content in the DOCUMENT_ROOT of Apache server
  -- Make sure the user whom the Apache is running as has the Read&Write previlidges on 
     postcard/application/images, postcard/db and postcard/db/postcard.db

### Usage

  -- After setup, user can access the application via [https://DEPLOY-SITE/postcard]. In the XAMPP
     environment in which this web application is developed, the URL is [https://localhost/postcard].
     Please note that it has to be https for the user to access camera in the application.
  -- User can choose a way to get the image to make postcard: capturing an image via web camera,
     uploading an image file or drag & drop a image file.
  -- After user decide to use a certain image to make postcard, he/she will be brougt to the process
     page where the user can modify the image to contain a message and customize the style of the message
  -- User can send the postcard as an attachment to the recipient with optional name and message.
  -- A history of previously sent postcard can be shown in carousel. User can access the history via
     Postcards in the navigation bar.

### Trouble shooting

  -- Alert page: "connection is not secure"
     Where there is a problem with the Secure Website Certificate on a https site, the alert page is shown 
     on the web browser. 
     Chrome: To allow insecure localhost, copy 'chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost' to the Chrome's
     address bar, and enable the first item "Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost".
     Firefox: On the warning page, click Advanced; Click Add Exceptionâ€¦; On the Add Security Exception dialog
     confirm adding exception.
  -- Pop-up box: "Failed to generate postcard"
     When sending postcard by email, user might get this warning. Please make sure the last step in Setup section
     has been carried out.
     

### Design decisions
This web application has two sections. The first section is to enable the user to create their own postcards.
It includes Home page, the webcamera page, fileupload page, imagedragdrop page and the process page. The second 
section is used to display previously ceated postcards. It has postcards page.

The Home page provides three options as the image source to create post card, namely Web Camera, Upload File and 
Drag and Drop Image. It will redirect to a certain page based on the form selections. 

By embedding a video element in the webcamera page, the camera will be opened automatically. If the user click 
the Snapshot button, a snapshot will be displayed in the canvas below.

The fileupload page allows the user to choose an image type only file and preview the file.

The dragdrop page enable the user to drag & drop an image and previwe the image.

No matter what image source option is selected, it will redirect to the same process page once user decide to 
use the image for the postcard. On process page user can add message, customize the style of message and 
send it as an attachment in an email.

### MVC Architecture
This application is developed in a MVC framework "panique/mini". The controllers and models are developed in PHP 
while the views are developed with Html5/Javascript.

  -- Model: Postcards
     In Postcards, Create, Read and Delete actions are implemented. Once a postcard is created it won't be
     changed, thus Update action is not implemented.
  -- Controler: Home, Source, Process and Postcards
     Home: the home page
     Source: three actions are implemented: webcamera, upload and drag & drop
     Process: index action is for the text editing on image; sendEmail is an ajax action for email sending; 
              loadImage is an ajax action to get an image file in a MVC architecture;
     Problem: the error page when no controler/action is found by router.
     unitTest: to test the model "Postcards"
  -- View: Each action, except Ajax action, has a view page.
